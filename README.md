This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks developed for my Master’s thesis: “Analysis of Observational Data for Enhanced Weather Diagnosis and Forecasting”
(TU Delft, 2025)

The thesis focuses on processing and analyzing observational atmospheric data — including measurements from a sonic anemometer, a 10 m-mast tower, IR/Solar radiometers and remote sensing insrtruments (microwave radiometer, cloud radar), as well as cloud classification, and surface energy balance evaluation — in order to improve understanding of boundary layer dynamics and weather diagnosis.

The full thesis is available online at the TU Delft repository.
